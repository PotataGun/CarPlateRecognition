# CarPlateRecognition
This is my final year project that uses Tensorflow and a live camera to capture a car plate.

# TAKE NOTE

1) This only contains the model training code which is the Training.ipynb
2) The Detect.py is the main function that will capture and extract the car plate and saved into the system.
3) Upload.py is a simple GUI for you to manage the car plate.
